# IR_Project
That's the project for the final for Information Retrieval class. The goal is to implement some basic Rank-Fusion techniques using Terrier, and to implement an advanced one.

## Tools
The tools we've been told to use are:
- **Terrier**: for indexing the collection
- **MATTERS**: for evaluating results

## Collection
Professor give us a specific collection to work with, the _TREC COLLECTION_, in particular the disk 4 and the disk 5 collection.
TREC is organized by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST), and its collection is divided into disks. Some data are accessible for free. In particular we're working on disk 4 and 5 collection, their pool (aka qrels) and their topic files.
